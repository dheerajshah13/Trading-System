# Trading-System
 Implementing the trading system with different modeling techniques for every market.
 Convolutional Neural Network followed by Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model is used to forecast the price of different stocks with around 83% accuracy
  Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model has been used to forecast the price of foreign exchange (USD/INR), (EUR/INR) with around 95% accuracy
 For Crypto, Bi-Directional LSTM has been used and for Commodity different modelling techniques, such as Multi-Headed ConvLSTM and Stacked LSTM for getting better accuracy.
 The whole project has been deployed on streamlit web application
